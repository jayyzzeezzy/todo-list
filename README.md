This is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

## Built With

- HTML
- Vanilla CSS
- Vanilla JS
- Webpack
- NodeJS

## Challenges

When I was starting out on this project, I struggled on narrowing down to the most optimal design pattern. 

I debated between constructors/classes, function factories, and IIFE module patterns. Eventually, I settled on function factories because I wanted more practice in that area. 

Other challenges that I've come across is trying to apply the OOP Principles (i.e. The Single Responsibility Principle and Loosely Coupled Objects), while also trying to write out some code to just have a working application. 

## What I learned

- DOM manipulation: create node, render info into each node, update node, and delete node. 
- Using Web Storage API (i.e. localStorage)
- JS design patterns
- OOP Principles
